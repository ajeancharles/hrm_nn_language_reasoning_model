First pilot of HRM for logical processing and analysis
It is set up to run as a Jupyter Python Notebook HRM_NN_Language_Reasoning.ipynb.
This is more of a demonstration of structure. More data and logic are needed.

Take a look at HRM_L0toL5.ipynb
Design the Hierarchical Architecture
NN Layer Structure:
Layer 0 (Token Level): Character/subword processing, basic pattern recognition
Layer 1 (Syntactic Level): Grammar rules, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
Layer 2 (Semantic Level): Entity recognition, relation extraction, semantic role labeling
Layer 3 (Discourse Level): Coreference resolution, discourse markers, paragraph coherence
Layer 4 (Pragmatic Level): Intent understanding, context integration, world knowledge
Layer 5 (Meta-Reasoning Level): Strategic reasoning, planning, meta-cognitive processes
