First pilot of HRM for logical processing and analysis
It is set up to run as a Jupyter Python Notebook HRM_NN_Language_Reasoning.ipynb.
This is more of a demonstration of structure. More data and logic are needed.

Take a look at HRM_L0toL5.ipynb
Design the Hierarchical Architecture
NN Layer Structure:
Layer 0 (Token Level): Character/subword processing, basic pattern recognition
Layer 1 (Syntactic Level): Grammar rules, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing
Layer 2 (Semantic Level): Entity recognition, relation extraction, semantic role labeling
Layer 3 (Discourse Level): Coreference resolution, discourse markers, paragraph coherence
Layer 4 (Pragmatic Level): Intent understanding, context integration, world knowledge
Layer 5 (Meta-Reasoning Level): Strategic reasoning, planning, meta-cognitive processes



legal_analysis_with_legal_entities.ipynb demonstrates examples of usage of legal semantic primitives to analyze legal text.
Common logical primitives in legal reasoning—such as entities, relationships, obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and conditions—serve as the key building blocks for representing, analyzing, and automating legal texts. Each primitive holds a distinct role in both human judicial reasoning and computational legal systems.

Entities
Entities represent the fundamental "actors" or "things" within legal scenarios—people, corporations, governments, physical items, or abstract concepts like rights or liabilities.
They are referenced in statutes, case law, and contracts as the starting point of any legal analysis (e.g., plaintiff, defendant, employer, asset).
Relationships
Relationships describe how entities connect in legal contexts, represented through verbs or predicates such as "owns", "employs", "transfers", or "is-party-to".
These links form the basis of legal rights and responsibilities, establishing who has interests, duties, or claims over whom or what.
Obligations
Obligations are normative statements requiring that an entity perform a specific action, typically formulated with words like "must", "shall", or "is required to".
Examples include contractual duties (e.g., “Tenant shall pay rent”) or statutory duties (e.g., “Corporation must file annual returns”).
Permissions
Permissions identify actions that entities are explicitly allowed to perform, denoted by terms such as "may", "can", or "is permitted to".
These statements carve out exceptions or discretionary powers within legal frameworks, supporting flexibility and choice without imposing duty.
Prohibitions
Prohibitions mark actions that are forbidden, commonly structured as "must not", "shall not", or "is prohibited from".
These are essential for enforcing constraints and protecting rights, such as “No person shall enter this area without authorization.”
Conditions
Conditions operate as antecedents for other logical primitives—often beginning with "if", "when", or "unless".
They provide context for activating rules, permissions, or prohibitions, enabling nuanced, situational reasoning (e.g., “If the contract is breached, damages must be paid”).
Integration in Legal Reasoning
Legal texts are often constructed as nested or chained structures: “If (Condition), then (Obligation/Permission/Prohibition) applies to (Entity) in relation to (Other Entity/Relationship).”
Advanced AI models and rule-based systems formalize these primitives using logical notation, decision trees, or object-oriented design, accurately reflecting the complexity and semantics of legal language.
Understanding these primitives is essential for designing AI systems capable of performing high-fidelity legal analysis, enabling not just machine translation of legal text but robust, context-sensitive adjudication.
