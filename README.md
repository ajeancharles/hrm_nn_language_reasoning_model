First pilot of HRM for logical processing and analysis
It is set up to run as a Jupyter Python Notebook HRM_NN_Language_Reasoning.ipynb.
This is more of a demonstration of structure. More data and logic are needed.

Take a look at **HRM_L0toL5.ipynb**<br>
Design the Hierarchical Architecture<br>
NN Layer Structure:<br>
Layer 0 (**Token Level**): Character/subword processing, basic pattern recognition<br>
Layer 1 (**Syntactic Level**): Grammar rules, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing<br>
Layer 2 (**Semantic Level**): Entity recognition, relation extraction, semantic role labeling<br>
Layer 3 (**Discourse Level**): Coreference resolution, discourse markers, paragraph coherence<br>
Layer 4 (**Pragmatic Level**): Intent understanding, context integration, world knowledge<br>
Layer 5 (**Meta-Reasoning Level**): Strategic reasoning, planning, meta-cognitive processes<br>

**legal_analysis_with_legal_entities.ipynb** demonstrates examples of usage of legal semantic primitives to analyze legal text.<br>
Common logical primitives in legal reasoning—such as entities, relationships, obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and conditions—serve as the key building blocks for representing, analyzing, and automating legal texts. Each primitive holds a distinct role in both human judicial reasoning and computational legal systems.<br>
<br>
**Entities**<br>
Entities represent the fundamental "actors" or "things" within legal scenarios—people, corporations, governments, physical items, or abstract concepts like rights or liabilities.<br>
They are referenced in statutes, case law, and contracts as the starting point of any legal analysis (e.g., plaintiff, defendant, employer, asset).<br>
**Relationships**<br>
Relationships describe how entities connect in legal contexts, represented through verbs or predicates such as "owns", "employs", "transfers", or "is-party-to".<br>
These links form the basis of legal rights and responsibilities, establishing who has interests, duties, or claims over whom or what.<br>
**Obligations**<br>
Obligations are normative statements requiring that an entity perform a specific action, typically formulated with words like "must", "shall", or "is required to".<br>
Examples include contractual duties (e.g., “Tenant shall pay rent”) or statutory duties (e.g., “Corporation must file annual returns”).<br>
**Permissions**<br>
Permissions identify actions that entities are explicitly allowed to perform, denoted by terms such as "may", "can", or "is permitted to".<br>
These statements carve out exceptions or discretionary powers within legal frameworks, supporting flexibility and choice without imposing duty.<br>
**Prohibitions**<br>
Prohibitions mark actions that are forbidden, commonly structured as "must not", "shall not", or "is prohibited from".<br>
These are essential for enforcing constraints and protecting rights, such as “No person shall enter this area without authorization.”<br>
**Conditions**<br>
Conditions operate as antecedents for other logical primitives—often beginning with "if", "when", or "unless".<br>
They provide context for activating rules, permissions, or prohibitions, enabling nuanced, situational reasoning (e.g., “If the contract is breached, damages must be paid”).<br>
<br>**Integration in Legal Reasoning**<br>
Legal texts are often constructed as nested or chained structures: “If (Condition), then (Obligation/Permission/Prohibition) applies to (Entity) in relation to (Other Entity/Relationship).”<br>
Advanced AI models and rule-based systems formalize these primitives using logical notation, decision trees, or object-oriented design, accurately reflecting the complexity and semantics of legal language.<br>
Understanding these primitives is essential for designing AI systems capable of performing high-fidelity legal analysis, enabling not just machine translation of legal text but robust, context-sensitive adjudication.<br>
