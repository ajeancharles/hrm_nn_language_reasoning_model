This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Having considered the parties' briefs 
and applicable law, the Court finds as follows:

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff John Smith alleges that Defendant Technology Corp. breached a software 
licensing agreement entered into on January 15, 2023. The agreement contained 
specific performance milestones and delivery requirements.

According to the Complaint, Defendant failed to deliver the contracted software 
modules by the agreed deadline of June 30, 2023. Plaintiff claims this breach 
resulted in significant business losses and reputational harm.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain 
sufficient factual matter to ""state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" 
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).

III. ANALYSIS

A. Contract Formation
The parties do not dispute that a valid contract existed. The agreement contained 
clear terms regarding deliverables, timelines, and performance standards.

B. Breach of Contract Elements
To establish a breach of contract claim, Plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of 
a valid contract; (2) Plaintiff's performance or excuse for non-performance; 
(3) Defendant's breach; and (4) resulting damages.

Here, Plaintiff has adequately alleged all elements. The complaint specifies the 
contract terms, Plaintiff's compliance, Defendant's failure to perform, and 
quantifiable damages.

C. Causation and Damages
Plaintiff's allegations establish a plausible causal connection between Defendant's 
breach and the claimed damages. The complaint details specific business losses 
directly attributable to the software delivery delays.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. Defendant shall 
file its Answer within 21 days of this Order.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

                    Defendant.        )

This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Having considered the parties' briefs 
and applicable law, the Court finds as follows:

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff John Smith alleges that Defendant Technology Corp. breached a software 
licensing agreement entered into on January 15, 2023. The agreement contained 
specific performance milestones and delivery requirements.

According to the Complaint, Defendant failed to deliver the contracted software 
modules by the agreed deadline of June 30, 2023. Plaintiff claims this breach 
resulted in significant business losses and reputational harm.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain 
sufficient factual matter to ""state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" 
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).

III. ANALYSIS

A. Contract Formation
The parties do not dispute that a valid contract existed. The agreement contained 
clear terms regarding deliverables, timelines, and performance standards.

B. Breach of Contract Elements
To establish a breach of contract claim, Plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of 
a valid contract; (2) Plaintiff's performance or excuse for non-performance; 
(3) Defendant's breach; and (4) resulting damages.

Here, Plaintiff has adequately alleged all elements. The complaint specifies the 
contract terms, Plaintiff's compliance, Defendant's failure to perform, and 
quantifiable damages.

C. Causation and Damages
Plaintiff's allegations establish a plausible causal connection between Defendant's 
breach and the claimed damages. The complaint details specific business losses 
directly attributable to the software delivery delays.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED. Defendant shall 
file its Answer within 21 days of this Order.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
